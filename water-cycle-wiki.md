## Introduction
As you can imagine, water is everywhere. Actually, around half of your body weight is composed of water. In natural world, water the main substance in the oceans. It also exists in the air as water vapor, in rivers and lakes, in icecaps and glaciers, in the ground as soil moisture and in aquifers, and you even could find water in rocks. Water is such a common stuff in our daily life that we may forget its importance sometimes. It’s easy to understand that water is essential for living body to function well and keep alive, but have you ever imagined that water even exerts a profound influence in climate system? In fact, water is so special and our earth would not be habitable without its existence. <br>

Within the relatively small range of air temperatures and pressures found at the Earth’s surface, water is the only known substance that can naturally exist in three phases: as a gas, a liquid, and solid ([Fig. 1](#Fig. 1)). When water undergoes phase changes, it’s accompanied by energy transfer. Plus the large heat capacity, water acts as the thermostat for the surface earth: prevent it from extreme coldness or warmth. Earth's water is always in movement, and now, this article hopes to give you some insights about the journey of water in a relatively scientific and quantitative way.

## Water cycle in the modern world
### Water distribution
There are about 1.385 billion km3 of water on Earth, over 96 percent of which is saline and most of which exist in liquid form. Fig. 2 and Chart 1 provide an estimated quantitative description of where Earth's water exists. Oceans, which cover nearly 71% of the Earth’s surface area, are the dominant reservoir in the global water cycle, holding over 96.5% of the world's water (1.338 billion km3). The number seems too large to imagine and we could use the Rhine river as a comparison: its annual flux is closely 100 km3, which means, it takes around 14 million years for the Rhine river to fill up the ocean basins. Other water stores on Earth are much smaller. Glaciers and permanent snow cover contain 24.4 million km3 of water, that is over 50 times less than the ocean volume. The third largest global water store is groundwater (23.4 million km3), but more than half of groundwater is not fresh.

|Reservoirs |Volume(1000 km3)	|Pecentage|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|	
|Oceans, Seas, and Bays	|1,338,000|	96.5
|Ice Caps, Glaciers, and <br> Permanent Snow	|24,064	|1.74
|Groundwater	|23,400	|1.7
|Soil Moisture	|16.5	|0.001
|Ground Ice and Permafrost	|300	|0.022
|Lakes	|176.4	|0.013
|Atmosphere|	12.9	|0.001
|Swamp Water|	11.47	|0.0008
|Rivers|	2.12	|0.0002
|Biological Water|	1.11|	0.0001
|Total	|1,385,984|	100.0

All the lakes on Earth contain 176 400 km3 of water and approximately 16 500 km3 of water is stored in the soil (0.04% of total freshwater), while all the rivers of the world carry, on average, in any time instant about 2120 km3 of water, being only 0.006% of total freshwater. In contrast, the atmosphere holds only 0.001% (13 000 km3) and wetlands about 11 500 km3 of water. A small amount of biological water (1120 km3) remains fixed in the living tissues of plants and animals. All the data cited here are taken from Gleick (1996). These values are estimates, and future studies will lead refinement of these values.

### The rule for quantitative understanding
First let’s imagine a water pool which has an inlet and outlet (Fig. 3). After a time interval (△t), the volume change of the pool only depends on the inflow and outflow through the inlet and outlet respectively. In this way, we could deal with the pool as a black box, only focusing on the boundary processes related with input and output while processes inside the pool being neglected. Such a pool is called reservoir or storage, and the inflow and outflow are called influx.

When studying the water cycle, we apply the similar method. For different purposes we can define the reservoir of different size and the number of ‘inlets’ and ‘outlets’ will vary correspondingly. Let’s take the ocean for an example. From a global scale, we can mainly focus on the water exchange with atmosphere through evaporation and precipitation, with continents through river runoff and groundwater processes and also with ocean floor. The last one takes place in a much longer timescale, so it will not be discussed here. But from a regional scale, for instance water cycle in a continental sea, besides the aforementioned elements, the exchange with adjunct ocean areas by current must also be taken into account.

Actually, this method, called the rule of balance or equation of conservation of mass, is the most essential, and universal, law guiding the water cycle. It reads, for any fixed reservoirs (pools): 

Inflow-Outflow=Change of storage

In this article, we will mainly include the most essential hydrological processes in earth surface, that is, the total precipitation, evaporation, runoff and change of storage. Then we can write the surface water balance as:
g_w=P-E-∆f
where g_w is the change of storage of water at and below the surface, P is the precipitation by rain and snow, E is the evaporation and ∆f is the runoff.

Averaged over a long period of time, the storage term is small. Hydrosphere is a closed system and water takes part in recycling rather than loss and replenishment processes. The resulting hydrologic balance for a long-term average is
∆f=P-E

To provide readers some ideas about the temporal change of water cycle, a time interval without modern instrumental documentation is chosen, so we used the data from TraCE 21ka modeling results. Since these data come from a climate model, there is some deviation from true values, but it could still show us some features about global water cycle.
