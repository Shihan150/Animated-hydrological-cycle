## Introduction
As you can imagine, water is everywhere. Actually, around half of your body weight is composed of water. In natural world, water the main substance in the oceans. It also exists in the air as water vapor, in rivers and lakes, in icecaps and glaciers, in the ground as soil moisture and in aquifers, and you even could find water in rocks. Water is such a common stuff in our daily life that we may forget its importance sometimes. It’s easy to understand that water is essential for living body to function well and keep alive, but have you ever imagined that water even exerts a profound influence in climate system? In fact, water is so special and our earth would not be habitable without its existence. <br>

Within the relatively small range of air temperatures and pressures found at the Earth’s surface, water is the only known substance that can naturally exist in three phases: as a gas, a liquid, and solid (Fig. 1). When water undergoes phase changes, it’s accompanied by energy transfer. Plus the large heat capacity, water acts as the thermostat for the surface earth: prevent it from extreme coldness or warmth. Earth's water is always in movement, and now, this article hopes to give you some insights about the journey of water in a relatively scientific and quantitative way.
