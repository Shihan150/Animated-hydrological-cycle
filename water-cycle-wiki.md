## Introduction
As you can imagine, water is everywhere. Actually, around half of your body weight is composed of water. In natural world, water the main substance in the oceans. It also exists in the air as water vapor, in rivers and lakes, in icecaps and glaciers, in the ground as soil moisture and in aquifers, and you even could find water in rocks. Water is such a common stuff in our daily life that we may forget its importance sometimes. It’s easy to understand that water is essential for living body to function well and keep alive, but have you ever imagined that water even exerts a profound influence in climate system? In fact, water is so special and our earth would not be habitable without its existence. <br>

Within the relatively small range of air temperatures and pressures found at the Earth’s surface, water is the only known substance that can naturally exist in three phases: as a gas, a liquid, and solid ([Fig. 1](#F1)). When water undergoes phase changes, it’s accompanied by energy transfer. Together with the large heat capacity, water acts as the thermostat for the surface earth: prevent it from extreme coldness or warmth. Earth's water is always in movement, and now, this article hopes to give you some insights about the journey of water in a relatively scientific and quantitative way.

## Water cycle in the modern world
### Water distribution
There are about 1.385 billion $km^3$ of water on Earth, over 96 percent of which is saline and most of which exist in liquid form. [Fig. 2](#F2) and [Chart 1](#C1) provide an estimated quantitative description of where Earth's water exists. Oceans, which cover nearly 71% of the Earth’s surface area, are the dominant reservoir in the global water cycle, holding over 96.5% of the world's water (1.338 billion $km^3$). The number seems too large to imagine and we could use the Rhine river as a comparison: its annual flux is closely 100 $km^3$, which means, it takes around 14 million years for the Rhine river to fill up the ocean basins. Other water stores on Earth are much smaller. Glaciers and permanent snow cover contain 24.1 million $km^3$ of water, that is over 50 times less than the ocean volume. The third largest global water store is groundwater (23.4 million $km^3$), but more than half of groundwater is not fresh.

| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
|       |       |       |
|Oceans, Seas, and Bays	|1,338,000|	96.5
|Ice Caps, Glaciers, and <br> Permanent Snow	|24,064	|1.74
|Groundwater	|23,400	|1.7

|Rivers|	2.12	|0.0002
|Biological Water|	1.11|	0.0001
|Total	|1,385,984|	100.0



All the lakes on Earth contain 176,400 $km^3$ of water and approximately 16,500 $km^3$ of water is stored in the soil, while all the rivers of the world carry, on average, in any time instant about 2120 $km^3$ of water. In contrast, the atmosphere holds only 0.001% (12,900 $km^3$) and swamp about 11 500 $km^3$ of water. A small amount of biological water (1110 $km^3$) remains fixed in the living tissues of plants and animals. All the data cited here are taken from the work edited by Gleick in 1996[$^1$](#R1). These values are estimates, and future studies will lead refinement of these values.

### The rule for quantitative understanding
First let’s imagine a water pool which has an inlet and outlet ([Fig. 3](#F3)). After a time interval ($\Delta t$), the volume change of the pool only depends on the inflow and outflow through the inlet and outlet. In this way, we could deal with the pool as a black box, only focusing on the boundary processes related with input and output while processes inside the pool being neglected. Such a pool is called the reservoir or storage, and the inflow and outflow are called influx.

	Fig.3 Cartoonish diagrams for the understanding of the rule of balance. The volume change inside the pool only depends on the inflow and outflow through the inlet and outlet.

When studying the water cycle, we apply the similar method. For different purposes we can define the reservoir of different size and the number of ‘inlets’ and ‘outlets’ will vary correspondingly. Let’s take the ocean for an example. From a global scale, we can mainly focus on the water exchange with atmosphere through evaporation and precipitation, with continents through river runoff and groundwater processes and also with ocean floor. The last one takes place in a much longer timescale, so it will not be discussed here. But from a regional scale, for instance water cycle in a continental sea, besides the aforementioned elements, the exchange with adjunct ocean areas by current must also be taken into account.

Actually, this method, called the rule of balance or equation of conservation of mass, is the most essential, and universal, law guiding the study of water cycle. It reads, for any fixed reservoirs (pools): 

$$Inflow-Outflow= Change \ of \ storage$$

In this article, we will primarily include the most essential hydrological processes in earth surface, that is, the total precipitation, evaporation and runoff. Then we can write the surface water balance as:
$$g_w=P-E-\Delta f$$
where $g_w$ is the change of storage of water at and below the surface, P is the precipitation by rain and snow, E is the evaporation and $\Delta f$ is the runoff.

Averaged over a long period of time, the storage term is small. Hydrosphere is a closed system and water takes part in recycling rather than loss and replenishment processes. The resulting hydrologic balance for a long-term average is:
$$\Delta f=P-E$$

To provide readers some ideas about the temporal change of water cycle, a time interval without modern instrumental documentation is chosen, so we used the data from TraCE 21ka modeling results. Since these data come from a climate model, some uncertainty and deviation true values exist inevitably, but it could still show us features about the key processes during the global water cycle.

### General picture of global cycle
To illuminate the general picture of global water cycle, we divide the surface areas into two large reservoirs: continent and ocean ([Fig. 4](#F4)). As stated above, the major water fluxes are evaporation, precipitation and runoff. Every year, the amount of water lifted by solar energy is around 493,000 $km^3$, which is equivalent to about a 1-m depth of liquid water spread uniformly over the surface of Earth. The water content in the atmosphere is around 12,900 $km^3$ ([Chart 1](#C1)), so the residence time for water vapor in the atmosphere is about 10days, which means that after evaporating, it takes the water vapor about 10 days on average before condensing and falling to the earth surface as precipitation.  

83% of evaporation (i.e., 410,000 $km^3$) comes from the oceanic surface and 17% (i.e., 83,000 $km^3$) from land. About 90% of the volume of water evaporating from oceans precipitates back onto oceans, while only 10% is transported to areas over land, where it precipitates. About two-thirds of the latter evaporate again and one-third runs off to the ocean. 

<span id='F4'>![](https://github.com/Shihan150/shihan.github.io/blob/master/figures/Figure4.jpg?raw=true)
		Fig. 4 Principle of the water balance between ocean and continent.

| |P($10^3 km^3$) |E($10^3 km^3$)	|P-E($10^3 km^3$)|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|	:---:|
|Globe|493|493|0
|Continent|123|83|40
|Ocean|370|410|-40

Based on these data, we can get the hydrologic balance equations for globe, continent and ocean ([Chart 2](#C2)). From the global scale, the volume of precipitation is equal to that of evaporation. But from continent’s or ocean’s perspective, there is the imbalance between precipitation and evaporation. This kind of difference represents the atmospheric water vapor transport from oceans to land, also being equal to the total runoff of Earth’s rivers and groundwater to the ocean.

This rough division could help us build up a basic idea about water cycle, but at the same time, some key processes are omitted and spatial variation cannot be resolved either. Therefore, in the following texts, we will describe the key elements of water cycle in a coordinate system with smaller defined reservoirs.

### Evaporation
Evaporation is the removal of water from the surface to the air with an accompanying change in phase from the liquid to the vapor form. You can imagine, the molecules in liquid water are held close together by attractive intermolecular forces ([Fig. 5](#F5)). In water vapor the molecules are much farther apart than in the liquid phase, so the intermolecular force is very much smaller. During evaporation, work is done against the attractive intermolecular force, and energy is absorbed. Therefore, the evaporation rate is generally controlled by the availability of energy at the evaporating surface. Besides, the difference of water vapor pressure between the water surface and the adjacent air can also influence the evaporation rate. If the adjacent air is relatively drier, the condensation rate will decrease and net evaporation increase correspondingly. One of the climatic meaning for evaporation is that it accounts for about half of the cooling of the surface that balances the heating by absorption of solar radiation.

		<span id='F5'>Fig. 5 Cartoonish diagram showing the molecular exchange between liquid water and atmosphere[$^2$](#R2)
. 

[Fig. 6c&d](#F6) shows that the global evaporation distribution is roughly zonally oriented, with larger evaporation (>181 cm/year) occurring over the subtropical latitudes of the global oceans and smaller evaporation (<89 cm/year) over the equatorial cold tongues and higher latitudes. As aforementioned, energy is the dominant controlling factor for evaporation, so this zonal distribution feature is easy to understand. It’s also notable that there are some exceptions. Firstly, the largest annual evaporation values don’t occur in the tropical areas but in the regions of ocean western boundary in subtropical areas. These anomaly high values are related with the heat carried by strong currents (like the Gulf Stream off the United States, the Kuroshio off Japan, the Agulhas Current off the African coast et al.). These currents are called western boundary currents by scientists and it’s another wonderful story for their formation[$^3$](#R3). Another exception is the relatively low evaporation in the equator zones. The explanation for it is that the surface air in the equator is the most humid in the world, which inhibits the net evaporation. The major contribution for the equator’s low value in the zonal map is the eastern tropical Pacific, where the evaporation rate (<100 cm/year) is much lower than other areas at same latitudes.

JJA and DJF stands for June, July, August and December, January, February respectively. More yellowish colors indicate the larger value and more bluish colors the smaller one. This colormap pattern apply for all the following figures. 
	
Seasonally, it is evident that oceanic evaporation in each hemisphere is intensified considerably during the wintertime. Such winter intensification is most pronounced over the regions of the Gulf Stream, the northern Indian ocean and Kuroshio ([Fig. 6a&b](#F6)), where the value of evaporation exceeds 300 cm/year in winter but is less than 135 cm/year in summer. The main reason is that the surface air in winter for these regions mainly come from the continent, which is very cold and dry, so the surface evaporation is reinforced.

The continent shows opposed seasonal feature. For continents ca. from 20° to 60° in both hemispheres, the evaporation is obviously stronger during summer time. Let’s take the southern African continent as an example, the value of evaporation is almost all above 160 cm/year in summer but only less 76 cm/year in winter. We can also see some areas with the weak evaporation through the whole year, including Sahara Desert, the Middle East, western coast of the USA and high-latitude zones.

In general, the annual-mean evaporation pattern for the ocean is dominated by the winter pattern and for the continent, by the summer pattern, of each hemisphere.


### Precipitation

After evaporation, water vapor can move with air parcel around the world. The amount of vapor that a volume of air can carry can be quantified by Clausius Clapeyron Equation:
$$\frac {1} {e_s}  \frac{de_s}{T} = \frac{l_v}{R_v T^2 }$$ ,
where $e_s$ is saturation vapor pressure above a liquid surface, $l_v$ is the enthalpy of vaporization (about 2.5×$10^6$ J), $R_v$ is the gas constant for water vapor (461.5 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$), and T is the absolute temperature (in unit K).

This equation tells us that the water vapor loading capacity of air depends on temperature significantly. For terrestrial conditions ($\frac {l_v}{(R_v T}$ ≈ 20), a 1% change in temperature, which is about 3°C, is associated with about a 20% change in saturation vapor pressure. 

When air parcel experiences expansion or cooling, its ability to carry water vapor will decline. In this case, we say the air is supersaturate and water vapor will condense on atmospheric particles, forming clouds. The clouds contain countless small drops of condensed water, which are too small to fall as precipitation. For precipitation to happen, first tiny water droplets must condense on even tinier dust, salt, or smoke particles, which act as a nucleus. Water droplets may grow as a result of additional condensation of water vapor when the particles collide. If enough collisions occur to produce a droplet with a fall velocity which exceeds the cloud updraft speed, then it will fall out of the cloud as precipitation.

		Fig. 7  Geographic and zonal distribution of annual mean precipitation. 

The general features of the zonal-average precipitation in [Fig. 7](#F7) are also apparent, with the largest precipitation (>200 cm/year zonally, >400cm cm/year in western tropical Pacific Ocean) near the equator, where the average water content of the air is high. In the subtropics convection and precipitation are suppressed by the downward mean air motion that characterizes this region[$^4$](#R4). In these latitudes precipitation is at a minimum (ca. 50cm/year). In midlatitudes precipitation increases again. The forced ascent of moist surface air in midlatitude weather systems and the westerly flow over obstacles such as the Rocky Mountains give rise to heavy precipitation. In the polar regions, precipitation decreases. The entire hydrologic cycle is slowed down in polar regions because of the low temperatures and consequently low water-carrying capacity of the atmosphere.

Generally speaking, precipitation is most abundant where air rises (e.g. tropical and midlatitude zones, the windward slope of the Tibet Plateau and the Rocky Mountains) and least abundant where it sinks (e.g. subtropical zones and the leeward slopes of huge mountains). It also tends to be greater near oceans and lakes, and in higher elevations.


#### ITCZ and monsoon
From [Fig. 7](#F7), we see that rainfall on Earth is most intense near the equator[$^5$](#R5). This narrow belt is called intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). It is a belt of low pressure where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres come together ([Fig. 8](#F8)). As these winds converge, moist air is forced upward, rises and cools, causing water vapor to be "squeezed" out and resulting heavy precipitation. The location of ITCZ migrated seasonally to the warmer hemisphere ([Fig. 9](#F9)): In boreal summer, over the Atlantic and Pacific, the ITCZ is between 5 and 15 degrees north of the Equator, but further north over Africa and Asia. In eastern Asia, the ITCZ may reach 30°N. While in boreal winter, over the Atlantic, the ITCZ generally sits no further south than the Equator, but extends much further south over the land masses of South America, Southern Africa, and Australia.  

We could imagine that, some tropical zones where ITCZ migrates through annually, will experience seasonal precipitation change. On the other hand, since the heat capacity of the continent is small compared with that of the upper ocean, the amplitude of the annual cycle in land surface temperatures is far greater than that occurring in tropical sea surface temperature. Therefore, these zones can also experience seasonal reverse of dominant wind direction. Such seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation are called monsoon.

		Fig. 8 Mean sea surface temperature distribution map with wind velocity vector superposed. The direction and length of arrows demonstrate the wind direction and velocity.

During the winter phase of the monsoon, there is a low-level flow of dry, cool air from the cold continent to warmer ocean, and precipitation over the land is light. During summer, there is a flow of atmospheric moisture from the tropical ocean to the warmer land, where the upward motion of the heated air produces the heavy rains of the monsoon season ([Fig. 9](#F9)). The Asian-Australian monsoon system is the most dominant monsoon circulation of the earth, where the summer-winter precipitation difference can reach more than 300 cm/year and monsoon areas extend furthest northward in east Asia (to around 30°N) . Such monsoon-type circulations also occur over west Africa and portions of Mexico and Central America. It’s also interesting to note that similar but less pronounced precipitation oscillation can also be observed in tropical ocean areas, which are far from the continents.

		Fig. 9 Geographic and zonal distribution of mean precipitation for the boreal summer (JJA) and winter (DJF). 

####  Indo-Pacific warm pool
Another noteworthy area is the western tropical pacific, where the annual mean sea surface temperature in highest 			(>28°C, [Fig. 8](#F8)). This area is called  Indo-Pacific warm pool. Intensive precipitation and evaporation also take 	place here. Since these hydrologic processes are accompanied with large amount of energy transfer, the warm pool zone is an important source to drive the atmospheric circulation and thereby the water cycle as well. 


### Regional P/E difference
Almost all the continental areas are with a positive P/E balance. In the meridional direction, evaporation exceeds precipitation in the belt from 15 to 40 degrees of latitude, and these regions export water vapor to be condensed in the latitudes where the precipitation maxima occur. The Indo-Pacific warm pool is the region which receives the largest freshwater input from the atmosphere annualy (more than 250 cm/year). This P/E difference distribution implies the net transport of water vapor in the atmosphere from the subtropics to the equatorial and high latitude zones. A return flow in the oceans or rivers carries water back toward the subtropics.

		Fig. 10 Global and zonal distribution of annual P/E difference in modern world.

In the zonal direction, it seems that the dominant trend in the Atlantic Ocean is the net water loss. To confirm this conjuration, we use other climatic datasets to calculate the surface water balance over the major ocean basins ([Chart 3](#C3)). The results show that there is a negative imbalance of fresh water in the Atlantic region and this imbalance can only be partly compensated by the continental runoff. The vapor loss results in the enrichment of salt in Atlantic Ocean. [Fig. 11](#F11) shows that, at the same latitudes, Atlantic is saltier than Pacific. Had the salt buildup not been compensated, the Atlantic's salinity would have increased gradually. Obviously, this cannot have been the case. Therefore, there must be some pathway to compensate the freshwater loss and the salt buildup taking place in Atlantic.

|Atlantic Ocean|	80|	102.7|	20	|-2.7|

Scientists do find such a pathway. The streamfunction map can tell us the net water flux and direction between any two points in the map. The water flux equates the difference between two streamline values and the direction is the right angle from the larger value to the smaller one. [Fig. 12](#F12) shows that, surface Atlantic water (fresher) flows northward and deep part (saltier) southward, and it’s exactly the opposite for the Pacific.

		Fig. 12 Annual-mean streamfunction (Sv) in Atlantic (left) and Pacific (right) ocean averaged over 1850 to 1980 AD.

The water movement in the Atlantic and Pacific is the component of a global-scale circulation, which is called the great ocean conveyor (Fig. 13). The conveyor belt transfers warm water from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic as a shallow current and returns cold water from the Atlantic to the Pacific as a deep current. Beginning in the central Pacific, it travels past the north coast of Australia and around the southern tip of Africa before moving up into the Atlantic. By the time it arrives the northern Atlantic and passes Europe, the surface water evaporates and the ocean water cools, releasing heat to the atmosphere. As the water becomes colder, it becomes dense enough to sink into depth. The deep water slowly travels south through the oceanic abyss, eventually mixing upward to the surface in different parts of the world. The whole process takes 1-2 thousand years.

## Water cycle in the past

An important task for geoscientists is to look into the past and find how our earth evolves gradually. In this chapter we will discuss the features of water cycle during last 1000 years and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).

### Last 1000 years: 850-1850AD
Some regional drought or flood events can be identified during 850-1850 AD from [Fig. 14&15](#F14), however, from a larger scale, the hydrologic cycle is almost same as that in modern world. For evaporation, the northern Atlantic undergoes the oscillation regularly, ranging from <-40 to >20 cm/year. The precipitation varied much more frequently and the changes mainly concentrate on the tropical zones.

		Fig. 15 Global and zonal prectipitation difference between last 1000 years and the modern world.
### Last glacial maximum
When 21 ka BP(ka BP, thousand years before 1950), Earth’s surface was totally different from its current appearance. The mean global surface temperature was around 3-4°C lower [$^9$](#R9). More water was stored in ice sheets, which covered Canada, the northern United States, northern Europe, and parts of Eurasia. As a consequence, global sea level was about 125 m lower, joining modern islands between Asia and Australia and connecting Britain to mainland Europe. In this world, water cycle also showed different features.
	
#### General cycle
Similarly, let’s look at the general picture of global water cycle during LGM at first. Compared to modern world, the annual global precipitation and evaporation are around 8% lower. That means, the water cycle at that time took place at a slower velocity. The drop is mainly attributed to the changes in the ocean: annual evaporation in the ocean decreases from 410 to 377 ($10^3 km^3$). More than 90% of the evaporating water from oceans precipitates back onto oceans. While for the land, the volume of evaporation and precipitation is almost the same as that in modern world. 

<center>Chart 4 Annual rough hydrologic balance during LGM</center>
|    |P($10^3 km^3/year$)	|E($10^3 km^3/year$)	|P-E($10^3 km^3/year$)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
|Globe	|455	|455	|0
|Continent|123	|78	|45
|Ocean	|332	|377	|-45

#### Spatial and temporal characters
[Fig.16b and 17b](#F16) shows that during LGM, the geographic distribution of evaporation and precipitation shares similar zonal patterns as that in modern world. Generally, for evaporation, the reduction can be seen in every latitude, with maximum in the tropical and subpolar zones and minimum in the subtropical and polar areas. The evaporation increase can be observed in ocean western boundary in subtropical areas and northern subpolar Pacific and Atlantic. In northern Atlantic and Pacific, extreme decrease occurs between two zones with evaporation increase: subtropical ocean western boundary and subpolar zones. 

For precipitation major decrease takes place in the low (10ºN-10ºS) and then high latitudes (>40°), while in the other zones, the value almost keeps same as that in modern world. The largest decrease occurs in the Indo-Pacific warm pool and the northwestern Indian Ocean (by more than 80 cm/year). A small increase even can be seen in the southern subtropical areas. The most distinguished precipitation change takes place in the tropical Pacific Ocean, where western and middle part experience the largest decrease and the eastern part the largest increase (>80 cm/year).

		Fig. 17 Global and zonal precipitation difference between LGM and the modern world.
	
Seasonally, the changes of seasonal precipitation contrast ([Fig. 18](#F18)) is calculated by the formula: 
$$\vert{P(JJA, LGM) - P(DJF, modern)}\vert - \vert{P(JJA, modern) - P(DJF, modern)}\vert$$ 
It is evident that the seasonal precipitation difference over most of continental monsoon areas decreased during LGM. The maximum decline occurs over the South Asia, where the value reaches -144 to -180 cm/year. The eastern coast of South Amecica and some areas in Sub-Saharan Africa are exceptions and underwent the intensified seasonal precipitation changes during LGM. This kind of intensification can also be seen in some tropical oceanic areas, especially the Indian Ocean and the eastern Pacific Ocean. At 30°-40°N, it's interesting to see the converse situations in the eastern (decrease) and western part (amplification) of Atlantic Ocean.
